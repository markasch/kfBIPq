# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This book contains a presentation of Kalman filters, from basics to nonlinear and ensemble filters. 
To understand these well, examples are provided in the form of jupyter notebooks. 
Then the notion of Bayesian inverse problems (BIP) is introduced.  Finally, there is a detailed presentation of the use of the ensemble Kalman filter as a basis for the solution of *inverse problems.* This is denoted EKI, or ensemble Kalman inversion, following the magnificent work of Andrew Stuart and his collaborators.

This book is based upon a number of sources. 
The original Bayesian formulation for inverse problems [@Stuart2015] 
was the basis for the later ensemble Kalman inversion, presented in a 
series of papers [@Stuart2013; @Stuart2022; @Huang2022]. Bayesian data assimilation
is presented in detail in [@ReichCotter2015] and a general approach to Bayesian filtering can
be found in [@Sarkka2023].


In [@Asch2016] and [@LSZ2015] the reader can find detailed 
presentations of Kalman filter approaches for data assimilation. 
In  [@Asch2022] there are basic explanations of uncertainty 
quantification, inverse problems and their use for digital twins.
